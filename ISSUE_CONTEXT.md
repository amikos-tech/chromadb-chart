# Issue #123: [BUG] CORS wildcard validation incorrectly rejects '*' for Rust server (>= 1.0.0)

**State:** OPEN
**URL:** https://github.com/amikos-tech/chromadb-chart/issues/123

## Description

The Helm chart's `config.yaml` template (line 182-184) fails with an error if `chromadb.corsAllowOrigins` is set to `["*"]` for versions >= 1.0.0:

```yaml
{{- if and (eq (len .Values.chromadb.corsAllowOrigins) 1) (eq (index .Values.chromadb.corsAllowOrigins 0) "*") }}
  {{ fail "cors_allow_origins must not be set to '*' when only one origin is allowed" }}
{{- end }}
```

This validation was correct for the Python-based ChromaDB 1.0.0 server, but the new Rust-based server **does** support wildcard CORS origins. The sample config `single_node_full.yaml` in the Rust frontend confirms this:

```yaml
cors_allow_origins: ["*"]
```

## Expected Behavior

Setting `chromadb.corsAllowOrigins: ["*"]` should work for Rust-based Chroma versions (>= 1.0.0).

## Proposed Fix

Gate the wildcard CORS validation to only apply for Python-based versions, or remove it entirely since the Rust server handles invalid CORS at startup.
